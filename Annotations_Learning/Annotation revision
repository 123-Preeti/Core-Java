✅ Annotation in Java – Main Points (Bullet Points)
1. Definition

Annotations are metadata in Java.

They provide information to the compiler, JVM, and tools.

They do not change the actual program logic.

2. Purpose of Annotations

Provide instructions to compiler or runtime.

Reduce boilerplate code.

Support framework-based configuration.

Improve code readability and maintainability.

3. Types of Java Annotations

Built-in annotations (e.g., @Override, @Deprecated).

Meta-annotations (annotations that define other annotations).

Custom annotations (created using @interface).

4. Common Built-in Annotations

@Override → Ensures method overriding.

@Deprecated → Marks code as outdated.

@SuppressWarnings → Suppresses compiler warnings.

5. Meta-Annotations

@Retention → Defines how long annotation is kept (SOURCE, CLASS, RUNTIME).

@Target → Specifies where annotation can be applied (method, class, field).

@Inherited → Allows annotations to be inherited by subclasses.

@Documented → Includes annotation in Javadoc.

6. Custom Annotations

Created using @interface.

Can contain elements (like variables).

Elements can have default values.

Accessed at runtime using Reflection.

7. Annotations Used in Frameworks

Spring: @Autowired, @Component, @RestController.

Hibernate/JPA: @Entity, @Id, @Column.

JUnit/TestNG: @Test, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach.

8. Benefits of Using Annotations

Cleaner and more readable code.

Less XML configuration.

Automated dependency injection & mapping.

Helps with compiler checking & error prevention.

Reduces repetitive code.

9. Best Practices

Use correct @Target for accurate placement.

Avoid overusing annotations.

Keep annotation definitions simple.

Document custom annotations clearly.

Use annotations consistently across the project.
